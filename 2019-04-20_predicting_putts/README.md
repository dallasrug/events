_Abstract_: Shalima Zalsha and Lei (Drake) Shi of SMU conducted a study on how to best predict the probability that a putt will be converted on the PGA Tour. While other models are only based upon distance, this model looks at the golfer, the slope and several other factors to fine-tune the odds available.

They worked together with Edward Egros who helped facilitate the data and guided the model by helping to determine which factors matter and do not matter on the Tour.
