# Dallas RUG - Proposed Organization


*Created by: Mike Badescu*

*The suggestions below are to keep it simple for now, we are open to suggestions*


## Leadership Team (LT)

The LT is the visible interface between the group and the community.

- LT members must be approved by Larry (group organizer), per MeetUp rules
- LT members should volunteer themselves to be part of LT
- LT membership should be updated annually
- All LT members will be listed on the MeetUp website (Event Organizers)

### LT duties

- LT members should attend often (more than 1/2 meetings) and keep up to date with the group activities
- LT members should allow other members to contact them through MeetUp
- LT members should include in their profile an (indirect) way to contact them (e.g. link to GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, company, personal website)
- LT members are expected to let others know if they do not/cannot want to be involved with the LT
- LT members are expected to be part of at least one Working Group (WG)

### LT roster

- Larry D'Agostino, Organizer, https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-R-Users-Group/members/14060621/
- David Andrews, University of Dallas host, https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-R-Users-Group/members/14086085/

*All other current LT members should be contacted about their future involvement.*


## Working Groups (WG)

Goals / Scope:

- to delegate responsibility of the group activities
- each WG should have at least 2 members, preferably 3 or 4
- each WG should have one member that is part of the LT (and listed on the Website)
    + however, WG members are not necessarily part of LT
- a person can belong to more than one WG 


### Hosting WG

Duty: at least one member of this WG hosts each meeting (sometimes at short notice).
This WG takes care of the next event so that we do not cancel it.

- David and Larry are part of this WG, they approve final members of this WG
- members of this WG are expected to attend regularly
- members are expected to help with the organization of events (directions, book rooms, help with WiFi, etc.)


### Planning WG

Duty: Plan future events, e.g. talks, coding sessions, etc.
This WG insures that there are enough reasons for the Dallas RUG to continue its activity.

- members are expected to identify topics of interest to the community
- members are expected to receive, consider, and propose presentations / talks
- members are expected to contact other people to find presenters, etc.


### Finance WG

The main duty of this WG is to assure that we have the resources needed and that they are allocated wisely.

- Larry is part of this WG
- WG members are expected to review finances, advise with respect to planning activities
- WG members might be asked to help find sponsors for events


### Strategy WG

The main duty of this WG is to consider ways to improve the group over time.
This WG insures that the Dallas RUG not only survives, but thrives as well.

- WG members are expected to receive and consider ideas and suggestions of all types
- WG members are expected to facilitate communication
    + setup surveys to identify community preferences
    + identify best communication channel/forum for Dallas RUG
    + store files / public GitHub account (wikis, etc.)?
