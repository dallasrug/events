# Dallas R User Group - Code of Conduct

The Dallas R User Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Dallas R User group spaces, including meetups, Twitter, Slack, mailing lists, both online and offline. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Leadership Team.

Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

**Community Guidelines:**

* **Be friendly and patient**: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
* **Be welcoming**: Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
Harassment includes:
* **Be respectful:** We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. 

**Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:**
* Violent threats or language.
* Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").

* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names.

* Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

**On Slack:**

* Avoid using overtly sexual or offensive usernames or profile photos which might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Do not publish text/screenshots of anything shared in Slack without explicit consent from the author. This includes screenshots of private messages to public channels, as well as conversations on public channels to anywhere outside of Slack.
